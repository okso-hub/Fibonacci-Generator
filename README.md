# Fibonacci Generator

This program generates the Fibonacci sequence.

After running it via `python main.py` you will be asked to enter the length of the sequence you want to generate. If we want a sequence consisting of n=29 numbers we would enter the following:

```
‚ùØ python3 main.py
Length of Fibonacci sequence: 29
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765, 10946, 17711, 28657, 46368, 75025, 121393, 196418, 317811]
```

After having entered the length, the sequence will be put out.
